# Keylogger
A keylogging algorithm which accepts data entered in a windows shell prompt and writes the data entered into a .txt file in under 1 second.

## Rationale
The aim of the program is to secretly get the commands entered by a user and store these commands into a file called 
"keylogfile.txt" and repeatedly capture these commands so long as the terminating character "~" is not entered. 

The program is indented for running on Windows OS ONLY.
